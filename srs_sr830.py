    '''
        A command to the SR844 consists of a four character command mnemonic
        with optional ?, arguments if necessary, and a command terminator.
        The command, arguments and terminator may be separated by spaces. The
        terminator must be a linefeed <LF> or carriage return <CR> on RS232,
        or a linefeed <LF> or EOI on GPIB. No command processing occurs until
        a terminator is received

        '''DATA TRANSFER COMMANDS
           ======================
    
        OUTP ? i                Query the value of X (1), Y (2), R (3) or q (4). Returns ASCII floating point value.
        OUTR ? i                Query the value of Display i (1,2). Returns ASCII floating point value.
        SNAP ? i,j {,k,l,m,n}   The SNAP? command records the values of either 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6
                                parameters at a single instant. For example, SNAP? is a way to
                                query values of X and Y (or R and θ) which are taken at the same
                                time. This is important when the time constant is very short. Using
                                the OUTP? or OUTR? commands will result in time delays, which may
                                be greater than the time constant, between reading X and Y (or R
                                and θ). The SNAP? command requires at least two parameters and at
                                most six parameters. The parameters i, j, k, l, m, n select the
                                parameters below.

                                        10                     CH1 display
                                        11                     CH2 display
                                The requested values are returned in a single string with the
                                values separated by commas and in the order in which they were
                                requested. For example, the SNAP?1,2,9,5 will return the values of
                                X, Y, Freq and Aux In 1. These values will be returned in a single
                                string such as "0.951359,0.0253297,1000.00,1.234". The first value
                                is X, the second is Y, the third is f, and the fourth is Aux In 1.

                                The values of X and Y are recorded at a single instant. The values
                                of R and θ are also recorded at a single instant. Thus reading X,Y
                                OR R,θ yields a coherent snapshot of the output signal. If X,Y,R
                                and θ are all read, then the values of X,Y are recorded
                                approximately 10µs apart from R,θ. Thus, the values of X and Y may
                                not yield the exact values of R and θ from a single SNAP? query.

                                The values of the Aux Inputs may have an uncertainty of up to 32µs.
                                The frequency is computed only every other period or 40 ms, whichever is
                                longer.
                                The SNAP? command is a query only command. The SNAP? command
                                is used to record various parameters simultaneously, not to
                                transfer data quickly.
       
        SPTS ?                  Query the number of points stored in Display buffer.
        TRCA ? i, j, k          Read k>=1 points starting at bin j>=0 from Display i (1,2) buffer in ASCII floating point.
        TRCB ? i, j, k          Read k>=1 points starting at bin j>=0 from Display i (1,2) buffer in IEEE binary floating point.
        TRCL ? i, j, k          Read k>=1 points starting at bin j>=0 from Display i (1,2) buffer in non-normalized binary floating
                                point.                           
        FAST (?) {i}            The FAST command sets the data transfer mode on and off. The parameter i selects:
    
                                i=0: Off
                                i=1: On (DOS programs or other dedicated data collection computers)
                                i=2: On (Windows Operating System Programs)
                            
                                When the fast transfer mode is on, whenever data is sampled (during a scan), the
                                values of X and Y are automatically transmitted over GPIB (not available over RS232).
                                The sample rate sets the frequency of the data transfers. It is important that the
                                receiving interface be able to keep up with the transfers.
                            
                                To use the FAST2 mode, a ROM version of 1.06 or higher is required. The FAST2
                                version uses the lock-in transmit queue to buffer the GPIB data being sent to
                                the host.
                                Since the transmit queue can buffer a maximum of 63 X and Y data pairs, the host
                                can only be diverted for short periods of time (e.g. 120mS at 512Hz sample rate)
                                without causing the lock-in to "time out" and abort the FAST mode data transfer.
                            
                                The values of X and Y are transferred as signed integers, 2 bytes long (16 bits).
                                X is sent first followed by Y for a total of 4 bytes per sample. The values range
                                from -32768 to 32767. The value ±30000 represents ±full scale (i.e. the sensitivity).
                            
                                Offsets and expands are included in the values of X and Y. The transferred values are
                                (raw data - offset) x expand. The resulting value must still be a 16 bit integer.
                                The value ±30000 now represents ±full scale divided by the expand factor.
                                At fast sample rates, it is important that the receiving interface be able to keep
                                up. If the SR830 finds that the interface is not ready to receive a point, then the
                                fast transfer mode is turned off. The fast transfer mode may be turned off with the
                                FAST0 command.
                            
                                The transfer mode should be turned on (using FAST1 or FAST 2) before a scan is
                                started. Then use the STRD command (see below) to start a scan. After sending the
                                STRD command, immediately make the SR830 a talker and the controlling interface a
                                listener. Remember, the first transfer will occur with the first point in the scan.
                                If the scan is started from the front panel or from a trigger, then make sure that
                                the SR830 is a talker and the controlling interface a listener BEFORE the scan
                                actually starts.
        STRD                    Start a scan after 0.5sec delay. Use with Fast Data Transfer Mode.
